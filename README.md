# car_rental

The purpose of this project is to simulate a real world application with which an end user can rent a car. Some of the available operations a client would be able to do through the app are: authentication, an advanced search for the right auto vehicle, giving feedback on a car and get different information about the available cars. It communicates with an Oracle database and calls PL/SQL procedures and functions that are stored on the Oracle SQL server.

The GUI of the application is created using the Kivy library ( https://kivy.org/#home ).

The communication and interfacing with the database is made possible using the cx_Oracle library ( https://oracle.github.io/python-cx_Oracle/ ).
